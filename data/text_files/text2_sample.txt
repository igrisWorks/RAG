Known challenges of LLMs include:

Presenting false information when it does not have the answer.
Presenting out-of-date or generic information when the user expects a specific, current response.
Creating a response from non-authoritative sources.
Creating inaccurate responses due to terminology confusion, wherein different training sources use the same terminology to talk about different things.
